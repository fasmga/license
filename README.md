    <h3>POSL</h3>
    The <b>POSL</b> is a stronger modification of the Apache license made to heavily protect and recognize the developers and their work. It is used by any Paperboat platform/service (e.g. Typio) except if stated otherwise.

    *The code only needs to be published in case of edits to the original software. Derivative work does not need to be open-source.

    <h3><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-NEW!-red"> POSL-Lite</h3>
    The <b>POSL-Lite</b> is a condition-free license, lighter than both the POSL and the Apache but arguably stronger than the MIT, written to be used as the terms for most of Paperboat's internal open-source software. It protects the code and its author while allowing users to run the software, with any modification, without worries.
